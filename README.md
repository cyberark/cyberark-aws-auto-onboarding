Protecting privileged accounts is never an easy task. They must be identified and managed, but in most cases it takes time and effort to cover the entire organization network. This process is challenged even more in Cloud environments, due to its dynamic nature. Instances (containers and virtual servers) are ephemeral and may be spun up and down all the time, which may cause a situation in which privilege accounts of critical applications and workloads are not managed while they are active.

CyberArk provides a solution that detects unmanaged privileged SSH Keys in new created Unix/Linux EC2 instances and unmanaged Windows instances in Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments, and automatically onboards them to the CyberArk Vault. Once an SSH Key\Password is onboarded, it is changed immediately. This solution also detects when EC2 instances are terminated and subsequently deletes the irrelevant accounts from the Vault. 

Unlike schedule-based scanners, this is an Event Driven discovery that detects changes in the environment in real time. AWS CloudWatch informs CyberArk about new EC2 instances, and triggers the CyberArk Lambda function that initiates the onboarding process.

The solution is packaged as CloudFormation template, which automates deployment. We recommend that customers deploy it for all AWS accounts and on all Regions.

This solution supports CyberArk environments that are deployed in Cloud, and Hybrid architectures.


# Features
- Automatic onboarding and management of new AWS instances upon spin up
- Automatic de-provision accounts for terminated AWS instances
- Multi region support - Single solution deployment for all regions in the AWS account 
- Near real time on boarding of new instances spinning up  


# Prerequisites
This solution requires the following:

1. CyberArk PAS solution installed on prem / Cloud / Hybrid with v9.10 or higher 
2. Cyberark license must include SSH key manager 
3. Network access from the Lambda VPC to CyberArk's PVWA
4. The CPM that manages the SSH keys must have a network connection to the target devices (ex: vpc peering)
5. To connect to new instances, PSM must have a network connection to the target devices (ex: vpc peering)
6. The expected maximum number of instances must be within the number of accounts license limits  
7. PVWA configured with SSL (unless its a POC environment).
8. In the "UnixSSH" platform, set the "ChangeNotificationPeriod" value to 60 sec (this platform will be used for managing Unix accounts, and setting this parameter gives the instance time to boot before attempting to change the password) 
9. In the "WinServerLocal" platform, set the "ChangeNotificationPeriod" value to 60 sec (this platform will be used for managing Unix accounts, and setting this parameter gives the instance time to boot before attempting to change the password) 
10. Dedicated Vault user for the solution with the following authorizations (not Admin):

	| General Vault Permissions:|
	| ------ |
		 Add Safes

11. StackSet Enabled according to AWS documentation:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html

12. If the Keypair and/or the Safes already exist (not created by the solution), the Vault user must be the owner of these Safes with the following permissions:

	|	 Key Pair Safe Permissions:|
	| ------ |
		Add Accounts
		List Accounts
		Retrieve Account
		Update Accounts Properties

	|	 Unix Accounts Safe Permissions:|
	| ------ |
		Add Accounts
		List Accounts
		Delete Account
		Update Accounts Properties
		Initiate CPM account management operations


# Deployment using Cloud Formation 
This solution requires NAT GW to allow Lambda access to the AWS resources  
Reference for further information: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html
CyberArk example network template:
https://github.com/cyberark/pas-on-cloud/blob/master/aws/PAS-network-environment-NAT.json


1. Download cyberark-aws-auto-onboarding solution zip files and CloudFormation template from [https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-aws-auto-onboarding/tree/master/dist](https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-aws-auto-onboarding/tree/master/dist)

2. Upload the solution to your S3 Bucket in the same region you want to deploy the solution.(* see note) 
3. Deploy CyberArk-AOB-MultiRegion-CF.json.
4. Deploy CyberArk-AOB-MultiRegion-CF-VaultEnvCreation.yaml.
5. Deploy CyberArk-AOB-MultiRegion-StackSet.json.
6. Upload the old/existing key pairs used to create instances in your AWS region to the Key Pair Safe in the Vault according to the following name convention:
[AWSAccount].[Region].[KeyPairName]
example - 1231231231.us-east-2.Mykey


> ***Note:** this solution must to be installed in every AWS region. For each region, use a dedicated Vault user and make sure the Lambda VPC has a network acess to the PVWA.

# Solution Upgrade Procedure 
1. Replace the solution files in the bucket 
2. Update the cloudFormation stack with the new template

# Limitations
1. CyberArk currently supports onboarding SSH keys for the following AWS accounts:
 - AWS Linux, RHL AMIs: ec2-user
 - Ubuntu: ubuntu user
 - Centos: centos user
 - openSuse: root user
 - Debian: admin user
 - Fedora: fedora user
> Amazon AMI/custom AMI with a key that was created by the solution or uploaded in advance to the Safe in the Vault supplied in the solution deployment (not supplied hard coded by Amazon)

2. Existing AWS instances (pre-installed) are not onboarded automatically (only after restart)
3. This solution currently handles a maximum of 100 events in 4 seconds
4. EC2 instance public IPs must be elastic IPs to allow continous access and management after changing the instance state.
5. in order for the CPM to manage new Windows instances for some versions (you can find the list below), the user must run the following command manually on all new Windows instances:

```sh
netsh firewall set service RemoteAdmin enable
```

>**Note**: CPM will fail to rotate the password in a case this command hasn't been executed

##### List of Windows instances that require this command to be run manually:

- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base with Containers
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2017 Express
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2017 Web 
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2017 Standard
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2017 Enterprise
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2016 Express
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2016 Web 
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2016 Standard
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server 2016 Enterprise

# Debugging
* There are three main lambdas:
	1. SafeHandler - Creates the safes for the solution and uploads the solution main key pair.
	2. Elasticity - Onboard new instances to PAS.
	3. TrustMechanism - Responsible for SSM integration.
>**Note**: You can find the lambdas by searching in the cloudformation's resource tab `AWS::Lambda::Function`

* All information about debugging is available through AWS CloudWatch and can be accessed easily through each lambda function under monitoring section.
* Debugging level can be controlled by editing the SSM parameter -  `AOB_Debug_Level`.
* There are 3 debug levels :
	* Info - displays general information and errors.
	* Debug - displays detailed information and errors.
	* Trace - displays every call made by the solution in details.
